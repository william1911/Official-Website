#Digital Hazards Website
Here is our official website, we love to offer open source stuff to everybody! So here is the source code behind the [Digital Hazards Site](https://digitalhazards.net).

We don't include any of the web applications as they would be no use to you! And would no doubt result in a massive file for everybody to download, which nobody wants!

##What can i do with it?
DMCA protects a lot of our content from being duplicated and re-hosted online, so dont go and copy it! Learn from it and build your own! Trust us you will feel better for it! 

##How can i use this? 
Its pretty simple, you can either download the files locally and just browse through each of the .html files in your browser or you could put it on some kind of local web server such as apache or nginx.

###Warning
Error pages will not work unless you include the .htaccess files in your web server and enable them!
